## Welcome to an 8x8 CPaaS demo page!
This page has been put together by the EMEA solution engineering team to help showcase all the different APIs we have.

So, what _do_ we have?

- [Automation](./automation.md)
- [SMS](./sms.md)
- [ChatApps](./chatapps.md)
- [Verification (One Time Password)](./verification.md)
- Voice V1
- Number Masking
- Voice IVR
- Video Interaction
- Number Lookup

... and of course we also have [**_JaaS_**!](./jaas.md) :saxophone:

Which one will you look at first?
