# Video Interaction

8x8 Video Interaction product (Vi) is an enterprise tool designed to elevate customer engagement. It focuses on the one-to-one interactions through an out-of-the-box solution.  

In many situations, emails, chat, and phone calls are not the most efficient way to assist customers. In other situations, sending an employee on-site is a costly, time-consuming, and inefficient use of time.  

8x8 Vi helps enterprises tackle these challenges, by providing a better customer experience, optimized process, and decreased operational costs.  

8x8 Vi allows ‘Agents’ to interact via video with ‘Guests’(customers).
