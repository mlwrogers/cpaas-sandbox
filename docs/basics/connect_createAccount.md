## How do i create my Connect account?

1. Open up browser and navigate to the 8x8 Connect website: https://connect.8x8.com/login/signup
2. Sign up using your preferred email address.  
  * Pro tip: If you already have an account you can use `+` in combination with your email address to create a new unique account, thus enabling you to have multiple accounts associated to the same email inbox. i.e. `+newCustomerName` is shown in the screenshots below 👇🏻
3. Select the `Sign Up` button and follow the on-screen instructions, as depicted in the following images:
