## How to send your first SMS

Before you send your first SMS, make sure you know where to [find your subAccountId and your API token](/cpaas-wiki/docs/basics/apikey) as you will need those to send your SMS.

Once you know where to get those from, you can decide if you want to send SMS via a GUI in our Connect web portal or if you want to get going directly with the API?
We have a couple pages especially for you.
