## How to connect with SMPP.

ðŸ“˜ You can find the complete documentation for our SMPP support on our [developer website here.](https://developer.8x8.com/connect/reference/smpp-connection)
{: .bg-blue-000 }

A summary of how to connect to us using SMPP is below.

1. Before you can successfully bind to the 8x8 SMPP environment you must have a Connect account and have already spoken to you 8x8 Account manager to onboard your account for SMPP.
  - Due to the sensitivity and resource requirements of SMPP, you are required to have a dedicated account manager for SMPP connectivity. Please contact us if you have not yet been allocated to someone directly.
  - If you do not yet have a connect account, you check out the `basics` section of this wiki for instructions on [creating a new Connect account.](https://mlwrogers.github.io/cpaas-wiki/docs/basics/connect_createAccount/)
2. Once onboarded by working with your account Manager, we will provide you with the username and password required for your connection.
3. 8x8 SMPP environment has multiple servers. To benefit from our fault-tolerant, high availability platform we prefer SMPP customers to connect directly to our hostname. Based on location and traffic load your application will be automatically connected to the best server.

ðŸ“˜ You should connect to 8x8 SMPP servers using SMPP version 3.4.

For relaying DLR
 back to your platform, 8x8 servers will send back deliver_sm to any bind connected with the same systemId of the originating submit_sm PDU. This includes if you are sending from multiple sites; we will send to any active bind.

ðŸ“˜ You can find the DLR documentation our [developer website here.](https://developer.8x8.com/connect/reference/smpp-delivery-receipts)

### Throughput
Throughput is tailored to each customerâ€™s requirement during our onboarding process. By default you will be able to submit a maximum of 50 (TPS) messages per second for each connected bind. If you have high volume requirements please discuss your specific requirements with your account manager.
