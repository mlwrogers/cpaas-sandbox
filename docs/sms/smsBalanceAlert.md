## Can we configure a balance alert/warning?

Yes, this can be supported for both _postPay_ and _prePay_ accounts.

For our _postPay_ customers, we can set an agreed overdraft (subject to credit checks) and then we can configure a balance threshold alert to be sent via email.  This is configured by %.  For example, when you reach 85% of teh agreed overdraft an email is automatically sent out as an alert.

For out _prePay_ customers this is configured as the value you requie the low balance alert to be triggered.

If you would like to discuss upgrading your account from _prePay_ to _postPay_ or would like to set an alert on an existing account, please contact our sales team. [cpaas-support@8x8.com](mailto:cpaas-support@8x8.com)
