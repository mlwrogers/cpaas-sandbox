## Can we configure a balance alert/warning?

Yes, this is supported for our _postPay_ customers.  We can set an agreed overdraft (subject to credit checks) and then we can configure a balance threshold alert to be sent via email.

This is configured by %.  For example, when you reach 85% an email is automatically sent out as an alert.

If you have a _prePay_ account, unfortunatley alerts are not support.  Prepay accounts work simialr to a PAYG mobile, no credit, no ability to send messages.

If you would like to discuss upgrading your account from _prePay_ to _postPay_ please contact our sales team. [cpaas-support@8x8.com](mailto:cpaas-support@8x8.com)
