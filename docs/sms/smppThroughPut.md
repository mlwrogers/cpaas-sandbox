## What is the SMS throughput for my SMPP account?

Throughput is tailored to each customerâ€™s requirement during our onboarding process. By default you will be able to submit a maximum of 50 messages per second for each connected bind (50 TPS).  

We support 4 binds per subAccount, therefor you have a total of 200 TPS across 4 binds for each configured subAccount.  You can have multiple subAccounts.

If you have high volume requirements and need to increase the number of configured subAccounts or the TPS for your subAccount/s please contact your account manager to discuss your requirements.
