7.  You need to enter your Sender ID (SID). For this test, just enter '8x8'.

ðŸ“˜  Different countries have different regulations regarding what you can use as your SID and if you have to register/whitelist a brand name.  For outbound only use cases you can use an alphanumeric SID with up to 11 characters in length.  For 2-way SMS use cases you must use a Virtual Number, you cannot receive responses to an alphanumeric SID.  Please discuss your intended desintations with your account manager if you are unsure of any regulatory requirements.
