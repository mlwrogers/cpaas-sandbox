## How do i increase the SMS throughput for my SMPP account?

By default you will be able to submit a maximum of 50 messages per second for each connected bind (50 TPS).  
We support 4 binds per subAccount, therefor if you are currently using only 1 bind simply creating 3 further binds on the same subAccount will increase your available throughput x3 giving you have a total of 200 TPS across the 4 binds for each configured subAccount.

You can have multiple subAccounts, if you require additional subAccounts please contact your account manager.

If you have high volume requirements and you need to increase the TPS to higher than 50 for your subAccount/s please contact your account manager to discuss your requirements.
