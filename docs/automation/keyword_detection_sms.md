# Keyword Detection Demo

This will demonstrate how to create a simple workflow that when enabled will trigger each time an inbound message is received by our SMS sandbox and then automatically send a reply back to the sender.
We start by creating and activating the workflow.

We do this using an HTTPs POST request to our CPaaS platform with a simple JSON body.  As soon as the API call is made and the status set to _enabled_, the workflow is active and ready for use.
To quickly try this out with our working example, keep scrolling...If you're the developer then you can also take a look at the JSON used in the POST request to create the workflow definition.
It would look a bit like this:

```json
// placeholder

```

## Try it out yourself!
