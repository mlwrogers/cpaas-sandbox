# How to link into Viber

Universal links are the preferred method of linking to a Viber account, this is officially documented by Viber here. [placeholder]()

The base structure for these links is extremely simple to use:

These links can obviously be used in any number of places or hidden behind simple website buttons.  Here are a few working examples which will open up your own WhatsApp account ready to send a message to a specific WhatsApp business contact with a pre-composed message.  

## Buttons
A quick and easy way to use universal links from your website is to just make a few simple buttons.  You can use multiple links so as to have different pre-filled messages depending on the context, i.e. Support vs Sales vs Returns.

This button will initiate a conversation by sending a message into the 8x8 Converse Sandbox, from which an agent can respond and continue to have a 2-way conversation with the customer via WhatsApp.
