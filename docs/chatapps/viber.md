# How to link into Viber

Universal links are the preferred method of linking to a Viber account, this is officially documented by Viber here. [placeholder]()

The base structure for these links is extremely simple to use:

viber://add?number=NUMBER - open user page
viber://forward?text=foo - share text with selected users
viber://chats - opens chat tab
viber://calls - opens calls tab


These links can obviously be used in any number of places or hidden behind simple website buttons.  Here are a few working examples which will open up your own Viber account ready to send a message to a specific Viber business contact.

## Buttons

A quick and easy way to use universal links from your website is to just make a few simple buttons.
**Try it out!**

This button will initiate a conversation by sending a message into the 8x8 Converse Sandbox, from which an agent can respond and continue to have a 2-way conversation with the customer via Viber.

_Note: for more information about 8x8 Converse, take a look at the overview at the [CPaaS documentation site here.](https://developer.8x8.com/connect/docs/converse-overview)_

**Try Me**ðŸ‘‡

[Converse](viber://chat?service=19459){: .btn .btn-purple }

```js
// The pre-filled message used to initiate this interaction is: "Hi 8x8 team, I'd love to chat with someone about your APIs to help boost my customer engagement! ðŸš€ "
// The text is url-encoded and the final link used behind this button looks like this:
"link placeholder"
```
