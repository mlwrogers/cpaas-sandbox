## Can we get access to a Chat Apps sandbox before committing to a longer term agreement?

We are currently unable to provide access to any shared sender IDs nor a free trial/sandbox environment for testing any ChatApps channels (i.e. WhatsApp, Viber, Messenger etc.).

We understand a customers requirement to fully test and evaluate our service connections and delivery rates before making a long-term commercial commitment, therefore we are typically able to offer our customers a short 3 month agreement, with a 30 days notice period, to enable you to fully test the service.
