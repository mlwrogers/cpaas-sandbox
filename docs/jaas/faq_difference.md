## What's the difference between Jitsi and JaaS?

*Jitsi* is a set of open-source projects that allows you to easily build and deploy secure videoconferencing solutions. We are best known for our Jitsi Meet video conferencing platform, meet.jit.si where we host a Jitsi Meet instance that the community can use for totally free video conferences , and the Jitsi Videobridge that powers all of our multi-party video capabilities.
* You need to host Jitsi yourself, or use the free meet.jit.si which does not have the same level of extended features off the shelf that JaaS does.
* 8x8 offers no commercial support, SLA or services for Jitsi.

*Jitsi As A Service* or *JaaS* is a hosted enterprise-ready version of Jitsi.  It's a video meeting platform that allows developers, organizations, and businesses to easily build and deploy video solutions without having to worry about all the server infrastructure required for real-time video solutions.  JaaS is built as part of 8x8's worldwide infrastructure with datacenters in multiple countries.  
All 8x8 products that use video are built using our own JaaS infrastructure.  
* You do not need to host any Jitsi components yourself, making JaaS extremely quick to market with very low ongoing maintenance.
* 8x8 provide commercial Support and SLA for JaaS customers.
