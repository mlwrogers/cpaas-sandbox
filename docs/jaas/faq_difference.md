## What's the difference between Jitsi and JaaS?

*Jitsi* is a set of open-source projects that allows you to easily build and deploy secure videoconferencing solutions. Jitsi is perhaps best known for the Jitsi Meet video conferencing platform, meet.jit.si where a hosted instance of Jitsi Meet provides that community with totally free video conferences.  It is the Jitsi Videobridge that powers all of Jitsi's multi-party video capabilities.
* unless you are only using the Jitsi branded meet.jit.si service you have to build and host Jitsi components yourself.
  *  A self installed Jitsi does not come with everything out of the box.  You will have to install and setup everything to do with call recording, break in/out PSTN calling for example.
* 8x8 offers no commercial support, SLA or professional services for Self-hosted Jitsi deployments.

*Jitsi As A Service* or *JaaS* is a fully managed hosted enterprise-ready version of Jitsi and it's components.  It's a focused video meeting platform that allows developers, organisations, and businesses to easily build and deploy video solutions without having to worry about all the server infrastructure required for real-time video solutions.  JaaS is built as part of 8x8's worldwide infrastructure with datacenters in multiple countries, all the servers and software are looked after and maintained by 8x8.
**All 8x8 products that use video are built using our own JaaS infrastructure.**
* You do not need to host any Jitsi components yourself, making JaaS extremely quick to market with very low ongoing maintenance.
* 8x8 provides commercial Support and SLA for JaaS customers.
* Call recording is all ready to go as is Transcription, PSTN In/Out and Streaming services.
  * Some extra features do carry an extra cost. Learn more about [JaaS pricing here](https://jaas.8x8.vc/#/pricing).
* GDPR, HIPAA, Industry leading SLA, webhooks, white-label branding are just some of the advantages of the JaaS solution over a simple self-install.
