## How does JaaS billing work?

JaaS is billed on a per MAU basis.  MAU stands for Monthly Active User.
Learn more about what an MAU is and how count them on the ['What is an MAU'](/cpaas-wiki/jaas/faq_what_is_mau.md) page.  

The billing section within the JaaS console provides detailed billing information for your JaaS subscription. You can view your current and previous invoices, monthly balance, or download a selected invoice. You can also edit your account payment information or cancel your subscription.
