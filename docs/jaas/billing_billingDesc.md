## How does JaaS billing/Pricing work?

Unlike the large majority of other Video API providers who have based their pricing model on the time participants/users spend on a call with a _per-minute_ pricing structure, the JaaS team understood that along with this being hard to predict for most industries, this could build up to be a very costly investment for many customer use-cases.

Therefor JaaS offers the unique pricing model focused solely around the number of participants/users accessing the platform each month with a _‘Monthly Active User’ (MAU)_ focused model.

The number of users making calls is a factor that most businesses have some insight into, regardless of the industry, and can use that information to more accurately estimate usage.  This gives JaaS customers the ability to have a clear understanding of investment costs and so as to determine the scaleability and longevity of usage with JaaS.

## Summary
JaaS is billed on a per MAU basis.  

MAU stands for Monthly Active User.

Learn more about what an MAU is and how count them on the ['What is an MAU'](/cpaas-wiki/jaas/faq_what_is_mau) page in addition to some of the other common questions/answers around billing in this wiki.

The billing section within the JaaS console provides detailed billing information for your JaaS subscription. You can view your current and previous invoices, monthly balance, or download a selected invoice. You can also edit your account payment information or cancel your subscription.
