## Does JaaS have a staging environment?

Yes.
We can offer customers on _paid plans_ access to a completely separate staging (pre-production) environment.  This will give you the ability to see and test against all in-development features and JaaS updates before they are rolled out to the JaaS production servers.  

If you are already on a pain plan and would like access, please reach out to your 8x8 account manager or our sales team. [cpaas-sales@8x8.com](mailto:cpaas-sales@8x8.com)
