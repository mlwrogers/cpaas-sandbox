## Is it possible to stop people from recording a call?

Unfortunately, it’s impossible to completely prevent people from recording an online conference. They can simply use a screen recorder or external camera to capture what’s displayed on the screen.

One approach that may help you is to
a semi transparent identity number (each participant has a unique one) on video. No one shares a recorded video since it’s possible to find out who made it.
