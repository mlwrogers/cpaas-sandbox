## Do i get help & support with JaaS?

Help and support is here whenever you need it.

We want to build long-lasting partnerships with the companies that we work with and grow with our customers.  Unlike some vendors who will mandate that you invest in expensive additional support packages we aim to place our customers business needs as the top priority right away and have a team with over 20+ years experience available to you.

Many long standing Jitsi & WebRTC experts in addition to Jitsi's founders still head up the Jitsi/JaaS development and product teams inside 8x8 today and are just as passionate as when the Jitsi project was first dreamt up!

In addition to the sales & solution engineering teams, the 8x8 support team is available to you 24x7, you can raise a support ticket from within the JaaS console, in addition to regular email.

## We plan to grow, can you support us as we scale?

Yes, absolutely!

This is an important question and one that a lot of companies wish they could answer as confidently as the JaaS team. We have a highly available, massively scaled, reliable global infrastructure which is run and maintained by some of the best real-time communications engineers in the world.

This has made it even more important for us to focus on nurturing the relationships that we have with our customers and ensuring we continue to build strong partnerships as we aim to be a part of the journey for years to come.
