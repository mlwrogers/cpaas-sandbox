## Does JaaS support analytics?

 Yes, every JaaS account includes a ‘callstats.io light’ package which can you can access from the analytics tab inside the main [JaaS console](https://jaas.8x8.vc/).

 These analytics are created through an integration with our callstats.io product that is already directly integrated Jitsi & JaaS. Callstats.io is another 8x8 product and is a brilliant, WebRTC specific, call quality monitoring and analytics tool.  It can really help to enhance and maintain a high customer experience and can be invaluable tool for your support and dev teams for getting insight into your webRTC service, regardless as to if you choose to continue with Jitsi/JaaS or use a 3rd party WebRTC solution.
