## Does JaaS support analytics?

 Every JaaS account includes a ‘callstats.io light’ package which can you can access from the analytics tab inside the main [JaaS console](https://jaas.8x8.vc/).
 These analytics are created through an integration with our callstats.io product that is already directly integrated Jitsi & JaaS. It is a brilliant, WebRTC specific, call quality monitoring and analytics tool and can really help to enhance and maintain a high customer experience and be invaluable tool for your support and dev teams for getting insight into your webRTC service, regardless as to if you choose to continue with Jitsi/JaaS or use a 3rd party WebRTC solution.
