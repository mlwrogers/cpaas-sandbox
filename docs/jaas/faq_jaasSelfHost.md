## Can i install JaaS in my own data center?

No.

Jitsi As A Service or JaaS for short, is a fully managed hosted enterprise-ready version of Jitsi and it's components.  JaaS is only available as a hosted service from 8x8.

If you have a use case that, absolutely 100%, requires an on premise installation you can achieve this yourself using the underlying Jitsi components.  [Jitsi.org](https://jitsi.org/)

8x8 does not provide any SLA/support/consultancy for a self hosted Jitsi environment.

**READ ME** If you're only requirement for a self hosted, on premise installation is because of security and data storage regulations, before starting with your on premise installation of Jitsi please take a look through our [JaaS Security FaQ's](https://mlwrogers.github.io/cpaas-wiki/docs/jaas/jaasSecurity).  

8x8 does not store ANY user data within our data centers (cloud).
