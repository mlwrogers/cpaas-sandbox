## What happens if i downgrade my plan?

When you downgrade your plan, your current plan will be valid until the end of your billing cycle, the new downgraded plan will take effect on the first day of your next billing cycle.

## What happens if i upgrade my plan?

Upgrading your plan takes effect immediately; once you get the upgrade confirmation, your account will have moved to the new plan.

All JaaS plans are **precomits**, meaning that you pay the cost for the subscription upfront. Any additional charges or corrections will appear on your next invoice along with charges for the next month's subscription.

After upgrading, you will not be billed immediately, but charges will be applied on your next billing date. The billing period starts on a fix date each month. For example, letâ€™s say that you created your account on March 8th, then your billing period is from March 8th to April 8th (at which time the next invoice is generated). Upgrading does not change the account billing cycle.

*Important note:* any overage recorded before the upgrade will not be waived; in this case, you will be billed for any existing extra MAU consumed.

If you upgrade in the middle of your billing cycle, the cost of the new subscription plan will be prorated.

### Example Scenario:
Customer is on a JaaS Basic plan with an allocation of 300 MAU/month and a billing cycle of March 8th - April 8th.
Customer is billed $99 on March 8th.
Customer consumes 500 MAU in the first half of the billing cycle. The extra 200 MAU incurs an overage charge of $198 (200 x $0.99).
Customer upgrades to the JaaS Standard plan in the middle of their billing cycle. No invoice is issued on upgrade day.
Customer consumes a total of 1600 MAU during the entire billing cycle (which consists of 200 overage + 1400 from the old and new plan allocation).
On April 8th, the new billing cycle begins and an invoice is issued with the following:

The prorated cost of the upgraded Standard package during the previous cycle: 15 days = $249.50
The proration of the initial Basic package 15 days = -$49.50 (to be deducted from the total)
The cost of the MAU overage before the upgrade = $198
The cost of the Standard plan for the next cycle (April 8th - May 8th) = $499
