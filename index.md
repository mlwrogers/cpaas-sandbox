# Welcome to an 8x8 CPaaS demo page!
This page has been put together by the EMEA solution engineering team to help showcase all the different APIs we have.

So, what _do_ we have?

- [Automation](./docs/automation/)
- [SMS](./docs/sms/)
- [ChatApps](./docs/chatapps/)
- [Verification (One Time Password)](./docs/verification/)
- Voice V1
- Number Masking
- Voice IVR
- Video Interaction
- Number Lookup

... and of course we also have [**_JaaS_**!](./docs/jaas/) ðŸŽ·

Which one will you look at first?
